#### Types

Types provide a way to describe the shape of an object, providing better documentation, and allowing TypeScript to validate that your code is working correctly.

#### The TS Type System:

 - Helps us catch errors during *development*
 - Uses 'type annotations' to analyze our code
 - Only active during development
 - Doesn't provide any performance optimization


#### How to use TypeScript

TypeScript code is transformed into JavaScript code via the TypeScript compiler or Babel.
